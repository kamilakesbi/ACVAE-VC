# MVA - Audio Signal Analysis final project

This repository contains code for the MVA Audio Signal Analysis final project. I worked on the following paper : 

[*ACVAE-VC:Non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion with auxiliary classifier variational autoencoder*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05092.pdf)

The code is adapted from this repository : https://github.com/ariacat3366/ACVAE-VC

## Training
The model can be trained using notebook.ipynb. 

## Dataset : 
The data set can be downloaded here : https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3061 

For more details please refer to the the project presentation `presentation.pdf`
